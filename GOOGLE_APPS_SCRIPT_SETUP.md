## ðŸ“‹ What You Need to Do Next

### 1. Set Up Your Google Sheet (5 minutes)

1. **Create a new Google Sheet**:
   - Go to [sheets.google.com](https://sheets.google.com)
   - Click "Create" to make a new spreadsheet
   - Name it "AutoworkX Bookings"

2. **Add column headers** in row 1:
   ```
   A1: Name
   B1: Phone  
   C1: Email
   D1: Service
   E1: Message
   F1: Timestamp
   G1: Source
   ```

3. **Get your Sheet ID**:
   - Look at your Google Sheets URL: `https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/SHEET_ID_HERE/edit`
   - Copy the Sheet ID from the URL

### 2. Update Your Google Apps Script

1. **Open Apps Script**:
   - In your Google Sheet, go to **Extensions > Apps Script**
   - You should see your existing deployed script

2. **Update the script**:
   - Replace the existing code with the code from `google-apps-script.js` file I created
   - Update these variables at the top:
     ```javascript
     const SHEET_ID = 'YOUR_ACTUAL_SHEET_ID_HERE';
     const SHEET_NAME = 'Bookings'; // Or whatever you named your sheet tab
     const NOTIFICATION_EMAIL = 'your-email@autoworkx.com.au';
     ```

3. **Save and test**:
   - Save the script (Ctrl/Cmd + S)
   - Run the `setupSheet()` function once to create headers
   - Run the `testBookingSystem()` function to test

### 3. Verify the Integration

1. **Test your website form**:
   - Start your dev server: `npm run dev`
   - Fill out the booking form on your website
   - Submit it and check that:
     - âœ… You see a success message
     - âœ… Data appears in your Google Sheet
     - âœ… You receive an email notification (if enabled)

## ðŸ”§ Script Features

### What the Script Does:
- âœ… Receives form data from your website
- âœ… Validates and saves data to Google Sheets
- âœ… Sends email notifications for new bookings
- âœ… Handles errors gracefully
- âœ… Logs all activity for debugging

### Data Structure:
Each booking saves these fields:
- **Name**: Customer's full name
- **Phone**: Contact phone number
- **Email**: Customer's email address
- **Service**: Selected service type
- **Message**: Customer's description/notes
- **Timestamp**: When the booking was submitted
- **Source**: Always "Website Booking Form"

## ðŸš¨ Important Notes

### Security:
- âœ… The script is deployed with your Google account permissions
- âœ… Only your website can submit data (CORS configured)
- âœ… All data is stored in your private Google Sheet

### Rate Limits:
- Google Apps Script has usage quotas
- For normal business use, you won't hit these limits
- Monitor if you get many bookings per day

### Troubleshooting:
If form submissions aren't working:

1. **Check the Google Apps Script logs**:
   - Go to your Apps Script project
   - Click "Executions" to see recent runs
   - Check for any error messages

2. **Verify Sheet permissions**:
   - Make sure the Sheet ID is correct
   - Ensure the sheet tab name matches `SHEET_NAME`

3. **Test the script directly**:
   - Run `testBookingSystem()` in Apps Script
   - Check if test data appears in your sheet

## ðŸ“ž Need Help?

If you encounter any issues:
1. Check the browser console for error messages
2. Check Google Apps Script execution logs
3. Verify your Sheet ID and sheet name are correct

Once this is configured, you'll have a complete booking system that:
- âœ… Captures customer information from your website
- âœ… Stores it securely in Google Sheets  
- âœ… Notifies you via email

Your customers can now book services directly from your website! ðŸš€
